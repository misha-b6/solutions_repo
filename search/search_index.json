Horizontal Motion : Moves at constant velocity. 2. Vertical Motion : Affected by gravity. Ignoring air resistance, we assume: - Initial velocity: \\(v_0\\) - Launch angle: \\(\\theta\\) - Gravity: \\(g\\) The goal is to find how the range depends on \\(\\theta\\) . Step 2: Deriving the Equations of Motion Using kinematic equations: Horizontal Motion: Initial horizontal velocity: $$ v_{x0} = v_0\\cos(\\theta) $$ Horizontal displacement at time \\(t\\) : $$ x(t) = v_0\\cos(\\theta) t $$ Vertical Motion: Initial vertical velocity: $$ v_{y0} = v_0\\sin(\\theta) $$ Vertical displacement at time \\(t\\) : $$ y(t) = v_0\\sin(\\theta) t - \\frac{1}{2}gt^2 $$ The projectile reaches the ground when \\(y = 0\\) . Solving for \\(t\\) : \\[ t_f = \\frac{2v_0\\sin(\\theta)}{g}. \\] Step 3: Calculating the Range The range is the horizontal distance traveled before landing: \\[ R = x(t_f) = v_0\\cos(\\theta) t_f. \\] Substituting \\(t_f\\) : \\[ R = v_0\\cos(\\theta) \\times \\frac{2v_0\\sin(\\theta)}{g}. \\] Using \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 2\\sin(\\theta)\\cos(\\theta)\\) : \\[ R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}. \\] Step 4: Analyzing the Range Equation Effect of Angle : Maximum range occurs when \\(\\sin(2\\theta) = 1\\) , i.e., \\(\\theta = 45^\\circ\\) . The function is symmetric about \\(45^\\circ\\) , meaning angles like \\(30^\\circ\\) and \\(60^\\circ\\) yield the same range. Effect of Initial Velocity : Range increases quadratically with \\(v_0\\) . Effect of Gravity : Increasing \\(g\\) decreases range, as expected in stronger gravitational fields. import numpy as np import matplotlib.pyplot as plt # Parameters v0 = 20 # Initial velocity (m/s) g = 9.81 # Gravitational acceleration (m/s^2) angles = np.linspace(0, 90, 100) # Angles from 0 to 90 degrees radians = np.radians(angles) # Convert to radians # Compute range ranges = (v0**2 * np.sin(2 * radians)) / g # Plot results plt.figure(figsize=(8, 5)) plt.plot(angles, ranges, label=r\"$R = \\frac{v_0^2\\sin(2\\theta)}{g}$\") plt.xlabel(\"Angle (degrees)\") plt.ylabel(\"Range (m)\") plt.title(\"Projectile Range vs. Angle of Projection\") plt.legend() plt.grid() plt.show() Step 5: Practical Applications Sports : Finding the best angle for throwing a javelin or soccer ball. Engineering : Estimating landing zones for projectiles. Astronomy : Calculating trajectories of objects in space. Step 6: Model Limitations No Air Resistance : Real-world projectiles experience drag, which shortens the range. Different Heights : If launched from or landing on different heights, calculations must be adjusted. Wind Effects : Wind can increase or decrease range unpredictably. For greater accuracy, numerical methods (e.g., solving differential equations with drag) are required.","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#problem-1","text":"","title":"Problem 1"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#investigating-the-range-as-a-function-of-the-angle-of-projection","text":"","title":"Investigating the Range as a Function of the Angle of Projection"},{"location":"1%20Physics/1%20Mechanics/Problem_1/#step-1-understanding-projectile-motion","text":"Projectile motion follows two independent components: 1.
