To solve it numerically, we rewrite it as a system of first-order ODEs. Step 1.1: Approximate Solution for Small-Angle Oscillations To simplify the analysis, we consider the small-angle approximation: \\[\\sin\\theta \\approx \\theta\\] Substituting this into the original equation gives a linear second-order nonhomogeneous differential equation: \\[\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = A\\cos(\\omega t)\\] This is a standard linear ODE with constant coefficients and a cosine forcing term.

Homogeneous Solution Solve the homogeneous equation: \\[\\frac{d^2\\theta}{dt^2} + b\\frac{d\\theta}{dt} + \\frac{g}{L}\\theta = 0\\] Assume a solution of the form \\(\\theta_h(t) = e^{\\lambda t}\\) : Then: \\[\\lambda^2 + b\\lambda + \\frac{g}{L} = 0\\] Solve the characteristic equation: If the discriminant \\(D = b^2 - 4\\frac{g}{L} > 0\\) : overdamped If \\(D = 0\\) : critically damped If \\(D < 0\\) : underdamped (oscillatory), which gives: \\[\\theta_h(t) = e^{-\\frac{b}{2}t}(C_1\\cos(\\omega_0 t) + C_2\\sin(\\omega_0 t))\\] where: \\[\\omega_0 = \\sqrt{\\frac{g}{L} - \\frac{b^2}{4}}\\] 2. Particular Solution Assume a solution of the form: \\[\\theta_p(t) = B\\cos(\\omega t) + C\\sin(\\omega t)\\] Plug into the ODE and match coefficients. After simplification: The steady-state solution is: \\[\\theta_p(t) = \\frac{A}{\\sqrt{(\\frac{g}{L} - \\omega^2)^2 + (b\\omega)^2}} \\cos(\\omega t - \\delta)\\] where the phase shift \\(\\delta\\) is given by: \\[\\tan(\\delta) = \\frac{b\\omega}{\\frac{g}{L} - \\omega^2}\\] Final Approximate Solution: Combining both parts: \\[\\theta(t) = \\theta_h(t) + \\theta_p(t)\\] In the long term, the homogeneous part decays due to damping, and the system reaches a steady-state periodic solution with amplitude and phase depending on \\(A\\) , \\(b\\) , \\(\\omega\\) , and \\(\\frac{g}{L}\\) .

Newton\u2019s Law of Gravitation provides the gravitational force between them: \\[F_g = \\frac{G M m}{r^2}\\] The required centripetal force to maintain a circular orbit is: \\[F_c = m \\frac{v^2}{r}\\] Equating the two forces: \\[\\frac{G M m}{r^2} = m \\frac{v^2}{r}\\] Canceling \\(m\\) and simplifying: \\[v^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] The orbital speed \\(v\\) is related to the orbital period \\(T\\) by: \\[v = \\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\] Substitute into the previous equation: \\[\\left(\\frac{2\\pi r}{T}\\right)^2 = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] Now solve for \\(T^2\\) : \\[\\frac{4\\pi^2 r^2}{T^2} = \\frac{G M}{r}\\] Multiply both sides by \\(T^2\\) and divide by \\(G M\\) : \\[T^2 = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M} r^3\\] This is Kepler\u2019s Third Law , showing that: \\[T^2 \\propto r^3\\] The constant of proportionality depends only on the central mass \\(M\\) and physical constant \\(G\\) : \\[\\frac{T^2}{r^3} = \\frac{4\\pi^2}{G M}\\] Step 2: Implications for Planetary Motions Kepler\u2019s Third Law has deep implications for understanding planetary systems: Uniformity Across Planets : For planets orbiting the same body (like the Sun), the ratio \\(T^2/r^3\\) is constant. This means that we can compare orbits across the solar system using only period and radius. Example : If one planet is 2 times farther from the Sun than another, its period will be: \\[T = T_0 \\cdot \\left(\\frac{2r_0}{r_0}\\right)^{3/2} = T_0 \\cdot 2^{3/2} \\approx 2.828 \\cdot T_0\\] Role of Mass : The mass of the orbiting object \\(m\\) cancels in the derivation. So small satellites and large moons follow the same law, depending only on the central mass \\(M\\) . Applications : Calculating planetary distances Estimating stellar and planetary masses Predicting satellite orbits Step 3: Real-World Example \u2013 The Moon Let\u2019s use Kepler\u2019s law to estimate Earth\u2019s mass from the Moon\u2019s orbit: Orbital radius of Moon: \\(r = 3.84 \\times 10^8\\) m Period: \\(T = 27.32\\) days = \\(2.36 \\times 10^6\\) s Rearranging the law: \\[M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 r^3}{G T^2}\\] Plugging in values: \\[M = \\frac{4\\pi^2 (3.84 \\times 10^8)^3}{6.674 \\times 10^{-11} (2.36 \\times 10^6)^2}\\] This yields approximately \\(M \\approx 5.97 \\times 10^{24}\\) kg \u2014 a very accurate estimate of Earth's mass. This confirms both the validity and the precision of Kepler\u2019s Third Law.
